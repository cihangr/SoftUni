@CIHAN GUR

A mighty battle is coming. In the stormy nether realms, demons fight against each other for
supremacy in a duel from which only one will survive.
Your job, however, is not so exciting. You must sign in all the participants in the nether
realm's mighty battle's demon book.
A demon's name contains his health and his damage.
The sum of the asci codes of all characters (excluding numbers (0-9), arithmetic symbols
 ('+', '-', '*', '/') and delimiter dot ('.')) gives a demon's total health.
The sum of all numbers in his name forms his base damage. Note that you should consider
the plus '+' and minus '-' signs (e.g., +10 is 10 and -10 is -10). However, there are
some symbols ('*' and '/') that can further alter the base damage by multiplying or
dividing it by 2 (e.g. in the name "m15
c-5.0", the base damage is 15 + (-5.0) = 10 and then you need to multiply it by 2
(e.g. 10 * 2 = 20) and then divide it by 2 (e.g. 20 / 2 = 10)).
So, multiplication and division are applied only after all numbers are included
in the calculation and the order they appear in the name.
Input
The input will be read from the console. The input consists of a single line
containing all demon names separated by commas and zero or more spaces in the
format: "{demon name}, {demon name}, â€¦ , {demon name}"
Output
Print all demons, each on a separate line in the format:
"{demon name} - {health points} health, {damage points} damage"
Constraints
A demon's name will contain at least one character.
A demon's name cannot contain blank spaces ' ' or commas ','.
A floating-point number will always have digits before and after its decimal separator.
The number in a demon's name is considered everything that is a valid integer or
floating point number (with a dot '.' used as separator). For example, all these are
valid numbers: '4', '+4', '-4', '3.5', '+3.5', '-3.5'.


INPUT
M3ph-0.5s-0.5t0.0**

M3ph-0.5s-0.5t0.0** - 524 health, 8.00 damage

INPUT
M3ph1st0**, Azazel
OUTPUT
M3ph1st0** - 524 health, 16.00 damage
Azazel - 615 health, 0.00 damage
