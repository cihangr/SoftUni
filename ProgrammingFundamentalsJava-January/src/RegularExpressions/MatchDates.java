Write a program that matches a date in the format "dd{separator}MMM{separator}yyyy".
Use named capturing groups in your regular expression.
Compose the Regular Expression
Every valid date has the following characteristics:
Always starts with two digits, followed by a separator.
After that, it has one uppercase and two lowercase letters (e.g., Jan, Mar).
After that, it has a separator and exactly 4 digits (for the year).
The separator could be either of three things: a period ("."), a hyphen ("-") or a forward-slash ("/").
The separator needs to be the same for the whole date (e.g., 13.03.2016 is valid, 13.03/2016 is NOT).
Use a group back reference to check for this.
You can follow the table below to help with composing your RegEx:
Matching = 13/Jul/1928, 10-Nov-1934, 25.Dec.1937
Not Matching = 01/Jan-1951, 23/sept/1973, 1/Feb/2016
Use named capturing groups for the day, month, and year.
Since this problem requires more complex RegEx, which includes named capturing groups,
we'll take a look at how to construct it:
First off, we don't want anything at the start of our date, so we're going to use a word boundary "\b":â€¨
