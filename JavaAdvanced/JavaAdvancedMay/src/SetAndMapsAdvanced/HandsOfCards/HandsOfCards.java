@CIHAN GUR

You are given a sequence of people and what cards he draws from the deck for every person. The input
will be separate lines in the format:
"{personName}: {PT, PT, PT,â€¦ PT}"
Where P (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A) is the power of the card and T (S, H, D, C) is the type.
The input ends when a "JOKER" is drawn. The name can contain any ASCII symbol except ":". The input will
always be valid, and in the format described, there is no need to check it.
A single person cannot have more than one card with the same power and type. If he draws such a card, he
discards it. The people are playing with multiple decks. Each card has a value that is calculated by the
power multiplied by the type. Powers 2 to 10 have the same value, and J to A is 11 to 14. Types are mapped
to multipliers the following way (S -> 4, H-> 3, D -> 2, C -> 1).
Finally, print out the total value each player has in his hand in the format:
"{personName}: {value}"
